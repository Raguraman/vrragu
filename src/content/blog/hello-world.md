Welcome to my blog! I'm Raguraman Velu Ramachandran, an Applied AI Engineer, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on AI, machine learning, software engineering, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **AI/ML Engineering** — practical insights from building and deploying AI systems in production
- **Software Architecture** — designing scalable systems that serve ML models effectively
- **Tools & Workflows** — the tools, frameworks, and practices that make me more productive
- **Learning Notes** — distilling what I learn from papers, courses, and experiments

## Why a Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly. By putting ideas into words, I solidify my understanding and hopefully create something useful for others navigating similar challenges.

I believe in learning in public — sharing both successes and failures. Not every post will be polished perfection; some will be rough explorations of ideas I'm still working through.

## Let's Connect

If anything I write resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrragu/).
